- [x] Do not compress goa raw files
- [x] Create a function to identify biolink model classes from CURIES
- [x] Same as above for relationships - all relations writen but not in function - MISSING RO file
- [x] Add BGEE - edges files too big for merging to occur
- [x] Add UBERON
- [x] Add CL
- [x] Delete old files from project
- [x] Add database versions as yaml file
- [x] Add GOA isoforms - review this question
- [x] Map HPOA disease IDs to MONDO

- [x] Fix bgee code 
- [x] Remove UBERON/CL intersections in bgee file
- [x] Try to get Gene-RNA edges directly from rnacentral file - no gene names
- [x] Add config options to select databases to include - databases_config.yaml will automatically update merge_config
- [x] Explore KGX graph validation and summary cli commands
- [x] Import uniprot IDs and ensembl genes, proteins from ensembl
- [x] Drop pybiomart and download ensembl-entrez mappings directly from ensembl
- [x] Alter Ensembl version
- [x] Change BGEE CL to biolink:Cell
- [x] Update analysis notebook - based on merge.stats
- [x] Go through merged_graph stats
- [x] CL Uniprot IDs
- [x] Unique node values on notebooks
- [x] Add config options to remove certain nodes/edges of specific types (BFO, CARO, owl, etc.) - by category and predicate
- [x] Added Mirtarbase with RNACentral and Ensembl prefixes
- [ ] Verify KGX automatic annotations for edges and nodes
- [ ] Add conda environment file
- [ ] Add Docker file
- [ ] Add BGEE version
- [x] Add NPInter
